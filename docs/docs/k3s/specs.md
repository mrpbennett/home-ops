# Recommended Specifications for a Production k3s Cluster

## Control Plane Node (Master)

1. **Boot Drive (ETCD Storage)**:

   - **Type**: SSD (NVMe preferred for higher performance and reliability)
   - **Size**: 100 GB or more (depending on the size and number of resources managed by the cluster)

2. **Storage Drive**:

   - **Type**: SSD (NVMe preferred)
   - **Size**: 100 GB or more (separate from the boot drive for storing persistent data and logs)

3. **CPU / Cores**:

   - **Cores**: 4 cores (minimum)
   - **Type**: Multi-core processor (modern Intel or AMD processors with high clock speeds)

4. **Memory**:
   - **RAM**: 16 GB (minimum)

## Worker Node

1. **Boot Drive**:

   - **Type**: SSD (NVMe preferred)
   - **Size**: 50 GB or more (sufficient for OS and k3s runtime)

2. **Storage Drive**:

   - **Type**: SSD (NVMe preferred)
   - **Size**: 100 GB or more (additional storage can be added based on workload requirements)

3. **CPU / Cores**:

   - **Cores**: 2 cores (minimum)
   - **Type**: Multi-core processor (modern Intel or AMD processors with good performance per core)

4. **Memory**:
   - **RAM**: 8 GB (minimum)

## Additional Considerations

- **High Availability**: For a highly available control plane, deploy at least three control plane nodes to ensure resilience and fault tolerance.
- **Network**: Ensure high-speed networking (1 Gbps or higher) between nodes for optimal performance.
- **Backup and Recovery**: Implement regular backups of ETCD and other critical data to ensure disaster recovery capabilities.
- **Monitoring and Logging**: Deploy comprehensive monitoring and logging solutions to track the health and performance of the cluster.
- **Load Balancing**: Consider using a load balancer in front of the control plane nodes to distribute traffic evenly and provide redundancy.

These recommendations aim to provide a robust and reliable k3s production cluster. Adjustments may be necessary based on specific workload requirements and performance benchmarks.
