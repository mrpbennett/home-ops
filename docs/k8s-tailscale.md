To give a user full administrative access to the entire Kubernetes cluster, you'll need to bind the user to the `cluster-admin` `ClusterRole`, which is a built-in role in Kubernetes with full permissions across the cluster.

Here's how you can do it:

### Step 1: Create a `ClusterRoleBinding` for the User

You need to create a `ClusterRoleBinding` that binds the `cluster-admin` `ClusterRole` to your Tailscale user (`mrpbennett@github`). Below is the YAML configuration for this:

```yaml
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: ClusterRoleBinding
metadata:
  name: cluster-admin-binding-mrpbennett
subjects:
  - kind: User
    name: mrpbennett@github # your Tailscale user
    apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
roleRef:
  kind: ClusterRole
  name: cluster-admin
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
```

### Step 2: Apply the Configuration

Save the YAML content to a file, such as `cluster-admin-binding.yaml`, and apply it to your Kubernetes cluster using `kubectl`:

```bash
kubectl apply -f cluster-admin-binding.yaml
```

### Step 3: Verify the Admin Access

After applying the binding, your Tailscale user should have full administrative access to the cluster. You can verify this by performing an administrative action, such as viewing all resources in the cluster:

```bash
kubectl get all --all-namespaces
```

If this command succeeds without any "Forbidden" errors, the user has been successfully granted cluster-admin permissions.

### Summary

- The `cluster-admin` `ClusterRole` provides full administrative rights across the cluster.
- Binding this role to your user using a `ClusterRoleBinding` gives them full control over the cluster.

This setup will allow your Tailscale user to manage all resources and perform any administrative tasks within the Kubernetes cluster.
